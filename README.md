# Personal Library

Capable of documenting a book library into a database. Enter as many comments for each book needed. Use the *Sample Front-End* section to experience jQuery's Ajax calls and DOM manipulation in action. Alternatively, use the *Test API Response* section to receive a JSON response of your entries. Node and Express are used to implement a RESTful API for front-end HTTP request handling. Mongoose is used to make the communication between Node and MongoDB easier for the CRUD portion of the app. The Chai and Mocha testing tools combination are used for function testing.
